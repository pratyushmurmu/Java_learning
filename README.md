# 🚀 Java_Learning: The Journey to Mastery

### 🎯 The Mission Brief
> "To transform from a Java novice into a high-performance Software Engineer. This repository serves as my **Flight Log**, documenting my mastery of Java fundamentals, object-oriented principles, and eventually, the complex terrains of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)."

### 📊 Progress Tracker
This is my "Experience Bar." As I complete topics from my curriculum, they move from ⬜ to ✅.

#### **Phase 1: The Foundation**
- [x] **Introduction:** Download, Install, JDK vs JRE vs JVM
- [x] **Identifiers & Keywords:** Naming conventions and reserved words
- [x] **Data Types:** Primitives vs. Wrapper Classes
- [x] **Variables & Operators:** Variable scope, Arithmetic, and Logical operators
- [x] **Control Flow:** Decision Making (if-else), Loops (for/while), Jump Statements
- [x] **Project:** Number Guessing Game

#### **Phase 2: Logic & Structure**
- [x] **Methods:** Static vs Instance, Access Modifiers, Varargs
- [x] **Arrays:** Multi-Dimensional, Jagged, `final` Array logic
- [x] **Strings:** Immutability, String Pool, `concat()`, String Methods
- [ ] **OOP Concepts:** (Current Objective 🎯)

#### **Phase 3: The DSA Frontier (Upcoming)**
- [ ] Time & Space Complexity
- [ ] Linear Data Structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, Stacks)
- [ ] Non-Linear Data Structures (Trees, Graphs)

### 🚀 The "Plus Ultra" Philosophy
This repository is designed for **active code and measurable growth.** While theoretical notes are kept in a separate private knowledge base, this README acts as the public-facing dashboard for my technical evolution.
